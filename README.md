# SSE.jl
Sandvik's Smart Expansion (or probabily Stochastic Serie Exapansion?)

This project is a transription of Stephan Humeniuk's excellent Fortran code. It applies SSE on transverse field Ising model (TFI) to calculate ground state energy and magnetic properties.

We start from simplest path integral Monte Carlo, but the framework is designed for extensibility.

## How to use
(SSE is under development, this is just simplest path integral version, think before using it)
```
julia main.jl
```
Julia version should be 1.0.
