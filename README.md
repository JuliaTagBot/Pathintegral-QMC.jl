# SSE.jl
Sandvik's Smart Expansion (or probabily Stochastic Serie Exapansion?)

This project is a transription of Stephan Humeniuk's excellent Fortran code. It applies SSE on transverse field Ising model (TFI) to calculate ground state energy and magnetic properties.

The framework is designed for extensibility.

## How to use
(under development, think before using it)
```
julia main.jl
```
Julia version should be 1.0.
